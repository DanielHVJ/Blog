# The Taylor Rule: A benchmark for monetary policy?

The Taylor rule is a simple equation, that is intended to describe the interest rate decisions of Central Banks.

Originally, in his 1993 article, John Taylor pointed out that a simple mechanical rule that could not take into account the many factors policymakers consider in practice. As economist researchers, we often referred to various policy rules, including variants of the Taylor rule. However, it seems obvious that such rules could not incorporate all the relevant considerations for making policy in a complex dynamic economy.

To construct Figure 1, we followed Taylor’s original paper, considering only  CPI (no other measures were included as the GDP deflator). To measure the output gap, for the period through 2021-22, we used estimates prepared by Central Bank’s meetings. Importantly, the data used here are public and were known to policymakers at the time they made decisions.

The Taylor rule equation is the following:
$$
r = p + 0.5y + 0.5(p – 2) + 2
$$
_Where:_

*r = the Central Banks official funds rate*

*p = the rate of inflation*

*y = the percent deviation of real GDP from a target, as a potential output of the economy. Also, the variable y in the Taylor rule can be interpreted as the excess of actual GDP over potential output, also known as the output gap.*

As an example, we only considered the case of the Euro Area and Japan.

- First, we could argue that lower interest rates than prescribed by the Taylor rule during 2008-2009, and that its deviations were a major effect of the financial excesses and crisis.
- Second, from Figure 2, Central Bank’s monetary policy since the financial crisis has not been sufficiently rule-like, and that policy has been too easy. Following the Taylor rule, Central Banks would have ended their policy of near-zero interest rates several years ago.
- As for the period since the financial crisis, the Taylor rule suggests that the “right” funds rate was quite negative. Of course a negative interest rate is not feasible, then it seems sensible for monetary authorities to keep the interest rate close to zero while looking for other tools (like purchases of securities) to achieve further monetary ease. In that way, one of the limitations of the Taylor rule provides no guidance about what to do when the predicted rate is negative.
- Also, it is important to point out that the growth recovery has been disappointing. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 was the worst and it left deep scars on economies. The recovery faced other headwinds, such as tight fiscal policy from 2010 on the US and the resurgence of financial problems in Europe.

## Inflation dynamics after the recovery

The pandemic has triggered large price movements in some sectors, notably food, transportation, energy, and communications. Underestimating both the risks that inflation will remain high and the costs of Central Banks losing credibility. It is not sufficient to point to low bond yields as evidence that inflation expectations are under control. As[ Sargent and Silber](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-market-is-too-serene-about-inflation-interest-rate-paul-volcker-fomc-federal-reserve-price-stability-11641933266) argue, the bond market was an unreliable indicator during the Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s and it may be lagging again. 

The continued mix of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies gained momentum in 2021, combined with high prices, provides strong evidence of a shift in the inflation regime. Moreover, for some economies, high inflation readings are influencing price- and wage-setting on a scale that we have not witnessed in decades.

### A forecast exercise

Of course, inflation is notoriously difficult to forecast. The projections comes with considerable uncertainty, and inflation may be elevated for longer. Contributing factors could include surging housing costs and prolonged supply shortages in advanced and developing economies, or food-price pressure and currency depreciations in emerging markets.

However, a forecast accuracy should encourage greater reliance by policymakers on-trend measures of inflation. Put differently, any claim that a positive inflation surprise is transitory embeds the belief that inflation will recede on its own. In recent experience, trend inflation initially rose in the Euro area in the first quarter of 2021 with a 1.4%, on the other a positive inflation of the CPI for Japan apperared at the end of 2021 (0.8%). For the case of the Euro area, by September 2021, nearly all measures of core inflation exceeded the ECB’s stated longer-term goal. 

Putting this all together, Central Banks needs a plan to raise rates quickly and substantially. By how much? To get a sense of the magnitudes, we make a simple forecast exercise using the Baltic dry index to measure inflation and the Taylor rule, the results are displayed in Figure 1.

Turning to the more recent period, we see that by the end of 2021, PCI inflation running at about 7.5%, the Taylor rule implied a policy rate of nearly 8%. Even if core inflation comes down by a percentage point during 2022—that is, by more than the recent trimmed mean PCI inflation rate implies—the projected Taylor rule rate will remain above 5% for the half of 2022. While it is not obvious from the chart, for Central Banks to ensure inflation returns to its target of 2% at least during this year, policymakers likely will need to bring the short-term real interest rate into significantly positive territory. 

Contrary to the above, for Japan we expect a CPI inflation nearly of 0.8% for the first half of the year, however, the Taylor rule suggest a policy rate at 1.5% for the same period.

Starting with the history, we show the actual interest rate target in dashed colored lines and the Taylor rule rate in solid lines. For the case of the Euro area, the two follow each other relatively closely until 2015. Importantly, however, the policy rate falls persistently short of the Taylor rule rate after 2015-16, inflation rates were the lowest during that period. 

With these assumptions, we find that for the ECB the Taylor rule would have prescribed a higher interest rate after the crisis and a faster and deeper decline (see Figure 2). According to the Taylor rule, based on our estimations, 2017 would have been the point in time when the ECB should have started to raise the interest rate. In reality, this is when the ECB did the opposite by loosening further monetary conditions through its massive bond purchase program.

At the end of 2019, the beginning of the pandemic would have called for a decrease in its interest rate, but for the first half of 2021, the rule’s predicted policy rate points to a further increase led by another narrowing of the output gap and a high increment in inflation.

## Conclusions

In 2021 inflation rose very quickly, so it may still be possible to bring it down sharply without a recession. The more decisively policymakers act, the lower the long-run costs are likely to be. Indeed, we are skeptical of arguments that an aggressive monetary policy tightening would be particularly damaging over time to those with lower incomes. Rather, the experience of recent decades is that job and wage gains for those with low incomes are most closely associated with long, relatively steady expansions. Failure to restore price stability in a timely way would almost surely render this expansion disturbingly short compared to recent norms.
