    "This document proposes an experiment of optimal public expenditure under the economic recession of the Covid-19. The empirical part is based on a linear optimization model. We review the public expenditure of the Regional Government of Madrid; we propose a possible ‘stimulus spending’ package to battle the economic recession after the Covid-19. The linear optimization formula is expressed as a revision of the public budget with sufficient statistics of the expenditure, on the other hand, we propose to strengthen: the budget on health, education, and social policies, and other expenditures efficiently to increase economic growth in the following years.\n"

    "Empirical evidence suggests that policy simulations show that reducing allocations for secondary education and correspondingly increasing allocations of public education expenses for higher education, produce monotonically decreasing growth if an expansion of higher education does not foster technological progress. On the other hand, if higher education is well integrated with technological innovation, the former can become a powerful engine of inclusive growth. Moreover, Gonand et al. (2009) highlight that efficiency gains in education spending will have large effects on GDP in the long run. A 10% increase in educational output might raise GDP by an estimated 3-6% in the long run in most OECD countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, economic growth is not monotonically increasing with respect to expenditures on higher education when the latter is closely linked with technological innovation. Further, there are other important expenditures as health and economic promotion policies.\n",

    "For economic policymakers, ‘it is important to know how far a given economic sector can be expected to increase its output by simply increasing its efficiency, without absorbing further resources’. The effectiveness of public expenditure is more difficult to assess than efficiency since the outcome is influenced by political choices. The distinction between output and outcome is often blurred and the outcome is used in a substitutable manner. For example, the outputs of an education system are often measured in terms of performance, while efficiency in transports, could be measure in speed travel and environment cost. The effectiveness shows the success of the resources used in achieving the objectives set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This document chooses a narrower approach and considers the public spending allocated to the production of a given public service, like public spending on health, education, or infrastructure as a measure of input. Although policymakers are interested in the outcome, like increasing economic growth, it is only partly under their direct influence and not always achievable within one political cycle. Against the background of efficiency and effectiveness analyses, it is important to scrutinize both large spending items, like social protection, and small, but growth-enhancing ones. As regards the latter, even if the spending items account for a small share of total spending efficiently, they can have a major impact on the performance of an economy.\n"

We also developed a fuzzy method for applying the optimization model using different scenarios that were simulated using the budget of the previous economic recession (2013/2011) , and the budget from 2016, which reflects a higher increment in the budget and economic activity in general. \n",

Among the limitations, previous fiscal budgets are not in excel format so we cannot consider disaggregated chapters.```"

    "This document chooses a narrmver approach considering the public spending allocated to a given public service. Our results show the following tentative conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 shows the results for each model, in the first column we can sec that in growth episodes (no Covid-19), the distribution of expenditure would almost the same as the Official Financial plan, however with more investment in Social policies and increasing debt payments (it make sense to reduce debt under economic growth episodes), and considerable reductions in transportation and education. On the other hand, considering the budget allocation under economic recession (2010-2011), almost all budget allocation receives less investment, except for Health, transportation, and environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Health expenditure increases almost 2.3% during the recession, and the investment in environment plan in 2011 was of 602€ Mill. in 2019 it was of 216€ Mill. It makes sense that the 2nd model considers a higher allocation for Culture and Environment since the values for the 2nd model considered the Financial plans of 2011-2013.```\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the results for the fuzzy model taking the values of the 1st model plus the additional resources, we assume we got. the maximum of resources that policymakers could invest after Covid-19 considering a possible outbreak of the virus, it makes sense, increase Health and, Employment and Social policies for a most likely economic recession, and additionally, it is an opportunity for the first. time to invest. in Education and R&D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concluding, although the results arc tentative, it. also introduces good rules of budget management, that is, under growth episodes, you could increase public debt, and in recession, don't get overindebted, reviewing the Financial plans, Madrid never recovered its income budget, it just contracted debt . Also, it attracts my attention that the budget for a green policy is around 200€ Mill. for the next years, the third part of 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "After t his exercise for Public Budget, for the next future, it could be more interesting to take disaggregatcd information of each chapter to probably get a more precise idea of how we can increase public expenditure efficiency."
